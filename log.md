# 100 Days Of Code - Log
# This is my log of the next 100 days of code to help me become better at mainly web development
# I should also consult to my calendar to ensure that I have subjects setup for what I want to learn and plan ahead.

### Day 31: 09 Feburary, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hr

Done more work around functional programming doing the challenges!
Worked on the map, filter and reduce functions and even implemented my own of them to achieve the same functionality!
Felt like I made a lot of progress today although I'm not sure if they've gone through callbacks in JS...
Wanting to write more code to achieve my goals!

Day32:
Time Spent:1hr
Thoughts: More on functional programming and I'm happy it also took a deeper visit at the map, reduce and filter functions! Have worked with ese more today from the challenges!
#100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 31: 07 Feburary, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hr

OOP programming finished I found the IIFE, (Immediatly invoked function expression) really useful and eye opening to how people automatically run functions in specific ways
Especially in creating modules I will be asking my work if they wrote their Javascript like this to start a chain of invoked functions!

Teaching you about the concept of leaving variables and objects especially global ones so that you cannot break anything else outside of the scope you're working in
Also found the functional programming approach really aspiring and a nice and clean way of coding! Can't wait to use this in real time
has made me think about heavier about immutable objects and mutable objects

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day31:
Time Spent:1hr
Thoughts: I finished all of the OOP programming section and actually found the IIFE really helpful to clearing up how some JS was working at my workplace
Started functional programming and have found this amazing! :)
 #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp
 
### Day 30!: 06 Feburary, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hr

I had done a lot of the OOP part of learning Javascript with FCC and have found it fairly easy to understand
The only thing I didn't understand was somewhere they magically made animal become the supertype?

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day30:
Time Spent:1hr
Thoughts: I left the last 3 parts of object oriented programming for tomorrow as they were a different concept completely, 
the object orientation I find much easier than algorithms maybe I need to problem solve more?
#100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 29: 05 Feburary, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hr

Finished the algorithms and started the OOP part of JS
I struggled with chunky monkey in creating a multi dimensional array like this
Ended up using the basic solution and regret doing so!

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day29:
Time Spent:1hr
Thoughts: It took me ages to understand chunky monkey and in the end failed to actually do it 
(I couldn't grasp creating the multi dimensional array), I've now started the object oriented programming part! #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 28: 04 Feburary, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hr

Really close to finishing the basic algorithm scripting and have started to get a much better understanding of how to think of how to problem solve and eliminate problems
Happy with this progress! :) I should probably look to work on my CSS / HTML more again as I haven't done that since I started!

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day28:
Time Spent:1hr
Thoughts: I have just 1 algorithm left on the FCC and then the basic algorithm scripting is done! I left this one because it is already really late and thought it would be a nice brain teaser for tomorrow's practice!
#100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 27: 03 Feburary, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hr 30mins

Worked on the FCC algorithims and have managed to nearly finish of the entire section! getting closer and closer to learning more about libraries in JS
Also thinking of creating more of a schedule

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day27:
Time Spent:1hr
Thoughts: Completed nearly all of the Basic algorithms in FCC, thinking of starting to make a schedule for different days, to work on multiple things at once! 
Also read up on some stuff for work with summernote! :) #summernote #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 26: 30 January, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hr

Although I wasn't feeling up to doing that much I'm happy that I atleast completed the data structures chapter it has helped me increase my understanding of basic structures especially using them with arrays
I also like using the object notation but the bracket notation has become easier and easier to understand

Excited to start the scripting algorithims path of this Javascript course!

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day26: Time Spent:1hr Thoughts: Got distracted half way through BUT I did manage to finish the basic data structures in Javascript, 
I liked how complex you can essentially build it. As long as you keep a clear scope it becomes much easier to track! #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 25: 29 January, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hr

Started and finished the debugging, that really helped me feel like I knew how to use a debugger properly when I managed to finish all of the sections in 20 minutes (mostly just reading what to do)
Started working on basic data structure in JS and has  helped reinforce my learning of Arrays in JS (as well as what I know already)
Especially using useful functions such as, splice, slice, pop  and shift.

Found the spread operator from ES6 being used in Array's a really convenient way of coping other arrays over!

Happy with this progress today and has definietly helped reinforce what I've already learnt

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day25: Time Spent:1hr Thoughts: Was a slow start to get into but finished the debugging chapter really quick and have no started the basic data structures, 
going through arrays again after it did with the basic Javascript really helps reinforce! :) #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 24: 28 January, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hr

Finished regular expressions, will still need to practice them and think where they're good to put into place!
Happy with what I learned and some of the cool things, may think about making my own small cheatsheet to make things easier to remember!

Going to look to start the debugging challenges tomorrow and do them in 1 sitting! I feel quite confident with the debugging stages of JS

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day24: Time Spent:1hr Thoughts: Finished the regular expressions in FreeCodeCamp! 
Going to move onto debugging challenges which shouldn't take me long! :) #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 23: 24 January, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 30m

Twitter message says it all really... Still need to finish it plan on doing this in my next daily hour of code (although today wasn't an hour cause I had training)

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day24: Time Spent:30m Thoughts: Continued reading through and learning about the 
Regular expressions in JS, regular expressions are by far not one of my more favorable things #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 22: 22 January, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hr 10m

I have finished ES6 and found it incredibly useful with some of the valueable things that ES6 has!
However I find the way that they decided to create classes and constructors with setters and getters a little weird
Simply because the language actually needing them is hard to explain - it's not a strictly typed language?

Should research into why this is set this way!

Also started the painful regular expressions!

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day23: Time Spent:1hr 10m Thoughts: Finished ES6 today complimenting this with also starting the regular expressions -
which I plan to finish that and debugging tomorrow :)
 need to find a way to put all this to use and keep practicing! (fcc project)! #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp
 
### Day 21: 21 January, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 40mins

Bit shorter today because of travel and other pains as well as going to the gym
Found more syntax with ES6 that I didn't know existed such as string literal templates and these things are amazing in how they work.
Also got more practice with how destructuring objects inside of a funciton works and how you can remove using an inline function from it to map the object to another object (with chosen parameters)
really cool stuff at just the beginning! ES6 is pretty cool! :D

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day22: Time Spent:40mins Thoughts: Again found new syntaxes and how to use them in ES6 and found the string literal templates absolutely amazing, 
when I refactor code now I will look to use these where strings are used! :D #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 20: 20 January, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hour

Started working through the ES6 challenges and really enjoyed some of the new syntax's that I've learned that ES6 provides - this will make me think about how much I've missed in the JS world
Also done some brain storming of how I want to build a portfolio and that I will do it numerous times to work with different technologies (plain to libraries)!

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day21:
Time Spent:1h
Thoughts: Started and got about half way through ES6 some of the challenges made me have to think about how they were done and how some of these new syntax's work 
- once I realised how they work I now find them amazing!
#100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 19: 17 January, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hour

Finished Basic Javascript in FCC looking forward to doing some of the challenges!
Also going to be starting the ES6 Javascript tomorrow and may look to split what I'm doing each day
Trying to create some structure in what I'm learning

Felt like this was a bit easier than I thought the work was going to be
And finally stopped being an idiot if I want to test my code I can just run it in the console in my dev tools! :)

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day20: Time Spent:1h Thoughts: Bit of a smaller day today as I've finished the basic Javascript today! Excited to start ES6 JS :D 
- Also looking to do the portfolio project for html and css with versioning as I want to iterate and improve this! :) #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp


### Day 18: 16 January, 2019

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hour

Continued with FCC Javascript - Learned more about small intracacies of looping
Solved the problems fairly quickly and happy with how it's improving my problem solving skills

**Link To work:** [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org)

##Tweet Message:
Day18: Time Spent: 1h Thoughts: Yet more Javascript from FCC, 
I am starting to understand it more as it's different from other languages that I've coded in! #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

### Day 17: 12 December, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1hour

Kept getting very distracted whilst working didn't get as much done as I woudld of hoped.
To stop this I will only use music whilst im programming from Spotify rather than something like YouTube as this distracts me.

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 30 min block then another 30 min block later

Made more progress on doing the Javascript on FCC, happy with the progress
Starting to settle into a rythumn of whenever I'm at my computer to sit and do the work which feels amazing :)

Hoping to finish the basic Javascript and then also start mixing it up with doing my codepen portfolio

After more practice and possibly the libraries introduction will look to upgrade my portfolio!

Plan to make my portfolio an ongoing project
This also goes along with wanting to start blogging and writing about topics I find interesting in technology with research!

### Day 13: 08 December, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1-2h

Started Javascript on FCC page and had a look at how I want to do my personal portfolio page

Happy with the progression as I have nearly done all of the basic Javascript practices (struggled to understand what the one I'm currently on wants me to do)

Plan on continuing the Javascript courses and practicing more CSS and HTML pages especially thinking of starting a project for doing it for my volleyball team's website! :)

Deciding if I want to do all of the CSS myself and then after this decide if I'm going to use a library to do my portfolio (final version) or pure CSS

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Finished technical documentation page, with some lazy CSS and lazy CSS for mobile responsiveness

Finished HTML section in FCC and am planning on doing my personal portfolio page, will look at some designs and see what I like

Plan on writing the first version with my own CSS (and displaying that it's my own) - may rewrite using some libraries and add Javascript later on.

Last part of the HTML AND CSS side of FCC before finishing the first section! 

THEN STARTING JAVASCRIPT! :)

### Day 11: 29 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Writing content for the technical documentation page, off the top of my head as I wanted some content to go with it.
Should probably just use the web developers way of writing lots of words (usiung lorem esp)

It's fun writing content to take into the real world.

Didn't do much CSS today or any for that matter as got carried away writing content, hope to finish my technical documentation page tomorrow.

Will work heavily on my web page portfolio to make it look as nice as I can think.

### Day 10: 28 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Very distracted hour today, didn't get anywhere near as much done as I would of hoped.

(Due to big family thing)

Got some css done on layout, happy with how I'm making the layout, understand what the overflow-x and overflow-y are for now
Made some more understanding on how margin's work and creating seperation of concern.

Would like to understand more on how the margins impact responsive design for when you're making the browser go smaller or bigger.

Setup headers to display information.

Plan to display my content a lot clearer tomorrow and change the content that's written (to more useful content)

Reached all 14 tests ran from FCC for HTML just need to get 2 layout tests finished to have finished the FCC standard for this page.

Also analysing my HTML and CSS from codepen's built in tool, to ensure there are no errors.

Trying to create less duplicate properties in CSS from using more global selectors

Happy with my progress as I don't have to look on the web for answers as much anymore!

### Day 9: 27 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Very distracted hour today, didn't get anywhere near as much done as I would of hoped.

Got the setup for technical documentation page from FCC HTML done and have the tests ran - only layout to finish

Plan to experiment and make the layout / CSS look much nicer, may look to add an animation
Using responsive CSS again

For this page may try to make use of CSS grid and CSS flexbox and see how I want to structure the page

### Day 8: 26 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Created a fully responsive product landing page, happy with the outcome for how long I have spent on it

The responsiveness is a nice attempt quite pleased with how I've managed to use flex and other queries to make a nice bold site

Maybe should brush up on design of colours though as purple and green isn't recommended.

The navbar should be handled better responsively dependent on screen size

Overall happy with the page that I've created from the course of free code camp!

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Started the product landing page project, happy with the custom CSS and content that I have created so far!
More on trying to get the CSS working to how I want as I want to have the page fully responsive.

Used my understanding of CSS selectors from the Survey and this has helped me build some parts of the page a lot faster

Starting to notice my understanding for CSS a lot quicker to build things such as navbars and seperating the page

Overally happy with Sunday's work! :)
Messed around with a sticky navbar which was interesting to how it works

Need to understand, the shorthand of the CSS.

### Day 6: 24 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Finished the page, only improvements I can think of are slight tweaks to the feel of the look aside from this the main improvements are the checkboxes and the radio buttons!

Understanding the CSS selectors better especially when it comes to narrowing down on the HTML - Same again

Have a much better understanding of margins and spacing on how to make them nice

Also implemented media queries to have the CSS change the webpage dependent on the size of the view

Need to understand how padding and spacing work better as I find them very difficult but important

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Started the survey form on the free code camp page, decided to use flexbox with this form
Using lots of resources to understand what the heck is happening :) - I'm guessing this is just practice for designing

Should read up on Flexbox more again, happy with progress - going to mess around with this until I'm happy with the form being a nice looking up to date page

Used a site (see colorbook) to help gain a complementary colour with my main background color

Hopefully will get some pointers of Twitter (will put in today or tomorrow)

Flexbox design was inspired by (see design) as I thought using flex box would be a good way of understanding modern day CSS
will look into how and why they're using the selectors that they are using

Overall happy with today's practice as it was very segragated (due to irl)

Updated a bit of CSS on the tribute page
Started writing the survey page, also read up on CSS tips and what's the best way to write CSS

Not too impressed with today, didn't get much done as I thought I would

Should look into what the Tweet suggestions have mentioned!

### Day 2: 20 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Finished the CSS grid sections, further understanding how the grid system works when you have a parent element to control all of the elements including creating a grid in a grid of CSS

The CSS grid comes with ways of dealing with columns and rows and allowing for nice amounts of CSS to help structure code

Media queries can be used here to help make more responsive websites

Understanding this is very useful to creating nicely padded websites

Should look into how to design better and make better CSS now as these are fundamentals to building nice flowing websites

Also created the first code pen project and completed a basic tribute page (see code pen link) this should be done with better styling over time and will aim to make better CSS)

I'm doing this because I don't want to rely on CSS frameworks as well as dealing with all the bloat that comes with it.

**Reply's from Twitter**: 
Doublas 3D said: "View Width "vw" can be used instead of px, in, % w/CSS, like style="font-size: 5vw; padding-left: 1.25vw;" 
try justify, absolute and relative with position and think about z-index as well for styled overlap. Try many options for what works in this case may not in the next. GL"


**Thoughts** I should read up on CSS and design to make myself understand user design better for better CSS, need to practice using these techniques more as well

### Day 1: 19 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

With this hour I spent using freecodecamp to use it's responsive technologies as well as using the CSS flex system that is used inside of CSS3.

The responsive technologies, use things such as media queries to deal with certain width and height in pixels, then applying our own CSS rules.

**code snippet**
@media (max-width: 100px){
	CSS-RULES
}
**End of code snippet *

On top of using media queries I found out that images are responsive and we use (see code snippet) to deal with retina displays
otherwise we also use typography which use these to deal with responsive text vw, vh, (vwmin, vwmax need to double check these)

**code snippet**
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
  height: auto;
  **end of code snippet**

  Flex is very nicely used with containerising elements making it easier to manage parent and child elements together.
  You can use Flex to put elements into rows or containers which makes deciding where to put elements easier
  You can also deal with flexing elements with auto
  You can use flex's version of aligning elements inside of the container (this will override normal aligning styles)
  
**Thoughts:** I should read up on and try to remember how to deal with writing responsive technologies as well as using CSS flex to help create nicer flowing sites

### Day 0: 18 November, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 1h Day1: spent it learning to become better at CSS from freecodecamp, looking at applied visual design! :) Happy 100days of code start #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

**Worked on**: I worked on the applied visual design today, it has shown me a way of matching colours a lot better and how you can make colours compliment each other.

**Thoughts:** I've come to realise that CSS isn't as difficult as it seems it just takes patience and messing around with values to see what fits best for your site
