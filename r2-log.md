# 100 Days Of Code - Log
# This is my log of the next 100 days of code to help me become better at mainly web development
# I should also consult to my calendar to ensure that I have subjects setup for what I want to learn and plan ahead.

### Day 0: 28/04/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 3hr

**Worked on**: Portfolio

**Thoughts:** Created my mobile responsive portfolio, looking to add some simple landing pages etc to show some of the work that I can do

Started working on a product landing page taking some inspiration on what the product is and simply trying to recreate

Overall quite happy with today's progress, used pomodoro technique to stay on top of the work that I was currently doing.

For tomorrow: get the base product landing page complete, look into setting up raspberry pi webserver with nginx.

### Day 1: 29/04/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 50minutes

**Worked on**: Product landing page

**Thoughts:** Started building a product landing page but not sure how to do some of the css styling that the page has (that I'm taking for inspiration), so going to try and fix that tomorrow.

Quite happy to have done a bit more with CSS also found that I can use fas fa-bar (font awesome) for the navbar burger.

Also experimented with building a flexbox responsive navbar (didn't want to use display block).

For tomorrow: going to do more on the product landing page

### Day 2: 30/04/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 1 hour 30minutes

**Worked on**: Dartford Volleyball Club

**Thoughts:** Relooked at the design I left them with and wasn't overly satisfied, I feel that I could do much better

I'm struggling to design the site because I don't know what content will be going onto the site and what is useful for people.

Should look at how design all comes together to create things that look good and help people get through content.
