# 100 Days Of Code - Log
# This is my log of the next 100 days of code to help me become better at mainly web development
# I should also consult to my calendar to ensure that I have subjects setup for what I want to learn and plan ahead.

### Day 0: 28/04/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 3hr

**Worked on**: Portfolio

**Thoughts:** Created my mobile responsive portfolio, looking to add some simple landing pages etc to show some of the work that I can do

Started working on a product landing page taking some inspiration on what the product is and simply trying to recreate

Overall quite happy with today's progress, used pomodoro technique to stay on top of the work that I was currently doing.

For tomorrow: get the base product landing page complete, look into setting up raspberry pi webserver with nginx.

### Day 1: 29/04/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 50minutes

**Worked on**: Product landing page

**Thoughts:** Started building a product landing page but not sure how to do some of the css styling that the page has (that I'm taking for inspiration), so going to try and fix that tomorrow.

Quite happy to have done a bit more with CSS also found that I can use fas fa-bar (font awesome) for the navbar burger.

Also experimented with building a flexbox responsive navbar (didn't want to use display block).

For tomorrow: going to do more on the product landing page

### Day 2: 30/04/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 1 hour 30minutes

**Worked on**: Dartford Volleyball Club

**Thoughts:** Relooked at the design I left them with and wasn't overly satisfied, I feel that I could do much better

I'm struggling to design the site because I don't know what content will be going onto the site and what is useful for people.

Should look at how design all comes together to create things that look good and help people get through content.

### Day 3: 01/05/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 2 hours

**Worked on**: Dartford Volleyball Club

**Thoughts:** Adjusted the design for volleyball club, the mobile version of it is coming together and starting to get a bit more content onto the site

Just need to find out what they want.

### Day 4: 02/05/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 4 hours

**Worked on**: Raspberry Pi web server

**Thoughts:** Learned that a broken piece will waste a lot of time!
Fixed and got the Rpi Running with SSH straight from setup as a headless setup! Really happy with that, gotta figure out how I can save all the files and process!

Wrote my first blog post with setting up the Pi that I can also use as reference that I'm really happy with!

### Day 5: 03/05/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 2 hours

Want to figure out how to host this with the jekyll setup!

### Day 6: 04/05/20

### Day 7: 05/05/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 2 hours

**Worked on**: Jekyll and blog

### Day 8: 06/05/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 3 hours

**Worked on**: Blog and setting up LAMP stack

**Thoughts:** I setup a small LAMP stack on my raspberryPi and have configured it to work with MariaDb, this is a great way to get started with potentially hosting applications later on!

Also wrote a small article about each step that I took to do this!

### Day 9: 07/05/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 4 /5  hours

**Worked on**: Blogged and setup MERN stack

**Thoughts:** Setting up the MERN stack was really fun once I figured out how to do it, the problem is that I haven't figured out how to have that working with Nginx yet to actually display the Javascript, I can get it displaying from localhost on the raspberry Pi, but that's all at the moment!
